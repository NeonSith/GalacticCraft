This cozy cabin, built by Slep_deprived, is located to the east of the spawn point. Unfortunately, it became a target during the griefing attacks that impacted the server. In an effort to preserve its legacy, contributions of photos taken before the incidents are encouraged; interested individuals can submit their images by direct messaging NeonPork.
