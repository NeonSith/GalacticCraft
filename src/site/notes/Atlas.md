Atlas was a base constructed by Gorilla Eggs / Mustard Seed and was recognized as the second largest monument on the server. Located south of [[Zerobald\|Zerobald]]'s [[Swankle\|Swankle]], Atlas remained untouched during the griefing incidents that affected other areas. Its significance and size contributed to its prominence within the server's landscape.
