Industrial City was constructed by [[Zerobald\|Zerobald]] and is notable for its numerous industrial buildings and a giant piston door vault. Unlike other locations, Industrial City remained unscathed during the griefing incidents that occurred at the end of the season. Additionally, the city was connected to [[NeonPork\|NeonPork]]'s Railroad, enhancing its accessibility to others.
