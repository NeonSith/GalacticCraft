Swankle was constructed by [[Zerobald\|Zerobald]] and is notable for its numerous industrial buildings and a giant piston door vault. This base is located up the mountain west of spawn. Unlike other locations, Swankle remained unscathed during the griefing incidents that occurred at the end of the season. Additionally, the city was connected to [[NeonPork\|NeonPork]]'s Railroad, enhancing its accessibility and integration within the server's transportation network.
