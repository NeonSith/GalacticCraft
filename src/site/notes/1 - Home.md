# Welcome to the GalacticCraft Website!

### Information and Resources

❗DISCLAIMER ❗This is still under development and not finished.

🔔 HELP 🔔 Please look through all of your Minecraft photos for pictures from ANY GalacticCraft season. Also, If you have any details (Names, Descriptions, Photos, etc.) about your bases from any season, please let me know so I can update this and have as much information on here as possible.

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the [[Seasons\|Seasons]] and showcases builds created by [[Players\|Players]]. It serves as a nostalgic space for revisiting both past and present experiences within the GalacticCraft server. Players who participated in the server and notice any missing content or want to change their base name are encouraged to direct message NeonPork. Contributions of photographs from any season are warmly welcomed and greatly appreciated. 

Here is the server Dynmap: http://37.10.122.30:2585/#
