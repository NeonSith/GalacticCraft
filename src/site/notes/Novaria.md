Novaria was a developing base constructed by Automaticgamer, situated to the east of the spawn point. Unfortunately, it became a target for griefers during the season. Plans were in place for a community event in which Automaticgamer would judge builds created by players, highlighting the collaborative spirit of the server. However, the griefing incidents impacted the realization of this event and the overall development of Novaria.
