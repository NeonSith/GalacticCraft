Season five was characterized by high levels of activity, featuring an array of players. However, the season was prematurely concluded due to disruptions caused by several griefers, coinciding with a temporary lapse in server protection measures. Note that some images associated with this season may be outdated or taken following the griefing incidents. Contributions of additional images are encouraged; interested parties may submit their pictures to NeonPork.
