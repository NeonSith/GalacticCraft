![2024-03-18_17.02.31.png](/img/user/Images/2024-03-18_17.02.31.png)Falkenstadt was a city under development, constructed by NeonPork, and became one of the targets of griefers during the season. Situated northwest of the spawn point, it was considered one of the safest locations in Season Five. Despite its progress, Falkenstadt's development was hindered by the disruptive and terrible actions of the griefers. Falkenstadt was the founding city of the Railroad.
