Athenia was under construction by one of the server's most active players, Evilcreature. Located just south of the spawn point, it was among the hardest-hit locations during the griefing incidents. Athenia was connected to [[NeonPork\|NeonPork]]'s Railroad, enhancing its accessibility and integration within the server's transportation network.
